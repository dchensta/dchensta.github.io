# Middle Voice Surveys for Daniel Chen's Dissertation - Spring 2026

This survey is part of the research contribution of Daniel Chen’s dissertation for the PhD in Linguistics. Daniel is seeking your introspections on grammatical meanings as a native speaker of your language. The task is a simple categorization task: to diagnose passages that all use the same verb form as representing active voice or middle voice. 

The only requirement to participate is to be a native, fully fluent speaker of the language of the survey you are taking. 

Including reading the pre-description of middle voice, completing the survey should take approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on how long you wish to mull over the data.

This survey does not offer compensation, but it is likely that you will gain some invaluable wordsmithing intuitions that might come in handy for heated game nights or relaxing crossword clue-sleuthing!

All surveys from Chinese and Spanish are open until:
# March 13th, 2026
