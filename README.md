# Middle Voice Surveys for Daniel Chen's Dissertation - Fall 2025

This survey is part of the research contribution of Daniel Chenâ€™s dissertation for the PhD in Linguistics. Daniel is seeking your introspections on grammatical meanings as a native speaker of your language. The task is a simple categorization task: to diagnose passages that all use the same verb form as representing active voice or middle voice. 

The only requirement to participate is to be a native, fully fluent speaker of the language of the survey you are taking. If you are a native speaker of 2-3 of the languages (English, Chinese, Spanish), you are welcome to take the survey of multiple languages. However, please do not re-attempt surveys from the same language, i.e., only take one English survey. 

Including reading the pre-description of middle voice, completing the survey should take approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on how long you wish to mull over the data.

This survey does not offer compensation, but it is likely that you will gain some invaluable wordsmithing intuitions that might come in handy for heated game nights or relaxing crossword clue-sleuthing!

The surveys do not collect your information unless you are a CU Boulder Linguistics undergraduate student taking this survey for extra credit.
